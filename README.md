# Next.js 15 Error: Invalid Default Export in Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered in Next.js 15 applications where the default export of a page component is not a valid React component. This can lead to runtime errors and prevent the application from rendering correctly.

## Problem

When a page component's default export isn't a valid React component (e.g., missing a return statement, returning a non-JSX value, or containing syntax errors), Next.js 15 will throw an error.  This can be tricky to debug if the error messages aren't clear.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the default export of every page component is a valid React functional or class component that returns JSX.  Thorough code review and utilizing a linter can help prevent these issues.  Testing with different routes and scenarios will help catch these early.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about` to see the error.
